## Examples

* Oled Screen Brick : This is the area where you will show the degrees which you measured in Picobricks for Micro:Bit or any words. Let's write Hello on oled screen.                  

```blocks
picobricks.oledinit(60)
basic.forever(function () {
    picobricks.showString(
        0,
        0,
        "Hello!",
        1
    )
})
```

* RGB LED Brick : Here is the RGB LED bricks where notifiations are full of colorful explosions and at the same time it has a party atmosphere! Let's color red to all LEDS.

```blocks
let strip = picobricks.create(DigitalPin.P8, 3)
basic.forever(function () {
    strip.showColor(picobricks.rgbcolors(rgbColorsList.Red))
})
```

* Gesture Brick : This brick is your ticket to transforming mundane routines into an extraordinary experience. Let's show something to sensor and name of color scrolls on Micro:Bit screen.
 Read color and scroll on the Micro:Bit screen.

```blocks
picobricks.initGesture(gestureinit.color)
basic.forever(function () {
    basic.showString(picobricks.readColor())
})
```

* Button And Potentiometer Brick : Simple button can actually be the key to great power. Let's press button and result scrolls on Micro:Bit Screen. (0 or 1)

```blocks
basic.forever(function () {
    basic.showNumber(picobricks.buttonRead())
})
```

* Motor Driver Brick : This brick is not just a motor driver but also a tool to push the limits of your imagination and enjoy directing movement. Let's set 90 degree angle to servo 1 motor.

```blocks
basic.forever(function () {
    picobricks.servomotor(servoMotorType.servo1, 90)
})
```

* Piano And Gaming Brick : This brick designed of offer makers an interactive and exciting world. Let's play piano.

```blocks
picobricks.touchInit()
basic.forever(function () {
    picobricks.playPiano()
})
```

* Wireless Brick : This brick allows you create new and exciting experiences by using wireless communication. Draw smile icon on Micro:Bit when the selected IR controller button is pressed.

```blocks
picobricks.onIrButton(irButtonList.Number_1, irButtonAction.Pressed, function () {
    basic.showIcon(IconNames.Heart)
})
picobricks.connectIrReceiver(DigitalPin.P15)
```

* Temperature And Humidity Brick : This brick is designed to measure and monitor temperature and humidity levels. Let's scroll temperature value on the Micro:Bit screen.

```blocks
picobricks.shtcInit()
basic.forever(function () {
    basic.showNumber(picobricks.temperature(tempList.celsius))
})
```
